#  I'm Deepak Das

## 📌 Data Analyst | Power BI Developer | Business Analyst  

A data analyst with a strong grasp of Excel, SQL, and Power BI. I genuinely enjoy working with data, whether it’s exploring large datasets, uncovering trends, or building dashboards that make insights easy to act on.

At this stage of my career, I’m focused on applying what I’ve learned through hands-on projects to real-world business problems. I may not have industry experience just yet, but I’ve spent considerable time mastering key analytics tools and frameworks, and I’m confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully from day one.

I believe in continuous learning, adaptability, and clear communication — not just building dashboards, but telling stories with data that help teams make better decisions. I also enjoy sharing what I learn along the way, whether through platforms, posts, or conversations.
